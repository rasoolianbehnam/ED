1. Before installing the packages noted below, try to run transforme.php. If and only if you receive the error:

	"Call to undefined function normalizer_normalize()"

   will you need to perform all of the steps below. If you are lucky, you may already have PHP Int support enabled.


  For additional information go to: 

	http://freddyduarte.com/2013/08/14/installing-the-icu-libraries-and-the-php-intl-extension-on-a-mac/

  although the steps for Mac are relatively the same for Linux.


1.1 Go to your BackTrack VM and switch to root account: su - root.


1.2 Install the ICU Library (included in the folder with this file) needed to install php Intl package for Unicode support.

	tar -xvf icu4c-4_8_1-src.tgz
	cd icu/source
	./runConfigureICU Linux           <-- Here: If you want to configure it on Mac or other architecture just put the name (e.g. MacOSX) and check runConfigureICU script.
	make
	sudo make install


1.3 Install pecl:

	apt-get install php5-dev
	apt-get install php-pear


1.4 Install PHP Intl support:

	pecl install intl

   You will get the prompt and you can just hit Enter or input /usr/local.

   Specify where the ICU libraries and headers can be found [DEFAULT] : /usr/local.


1.5 Finally, just add the extension to php.ini and restart Apache.

	// Add this to the bottom of your php.ini file
	extension=intl.so


1.6 Restart Apache:

	apache2ctl stop
	apache2ctl start



Installing Proxy Fiddler2 and the plugin

2. Download Fiddler2 from:

	http://fiddler2.com/get-fiddler

3. Install Fiddler2 by running fiddler2setup.exe.

4. Download x5s Fiddler2’s extension:

	x5s: http://xss.codeplex.com/releases/view/43170

5. Install x5s by running X5Setup.

   Accept default folder installation since Fiddler will load the plugins from: 

	%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Fiddler2\Scripts\ folder so do not change the destination.
